# React/Node Project for TON Ecosystem Hackathon

## Project Overview

This project is developed for the TON ecosystem as part of the hackathon. It utilizes React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, and aims to provide a seamless and engaging experience for users through a Telegram Mini-App.

## Bringing Blockchain to a Wider Audience

Our project aims to bridge the gap between complex blockchain technology and everyday users by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. By integrating with the TON ecosystem, we make blockchain concepts accessible to a broader audience, demonstrating the practical benefits and functionalities of decentralized applications (dApps).

### Simple Token Acquisition

One of the standout features of our project is the simple and straightforward mechanism for obtaining tokens. Users can easily understand and engage with the process, eliminating the typical barriers associated with blockchain and cryptocurrency transactions. This simplicity encourages more users to participate and explore the benefits of blockchain technology.

### Seamless Integration with Telegram API

Our project leverages the extensive capabilities of the Telegram API, ensuring a tightly integrated experience within the Telegram ecosystem. This integration allows users to interact with the dApp directly through Telegram, making the process seamless and familiar. Features such as bot interactions, and data retrieval are handled efficiently, providing a smooth user experience.

### Referral Program

To promote growth and user engagement, our project includes a referral program. Users can invite friends and earn rewards, incentivizing the spread of our application. This program is designed to be easy to use, track, and manage, encouraging users to actively participate and expand the community.

### Quest Chain

To keep users engaged and motivated, our project features a series of quests. These quests guide users through various functionalities and features of the dApp, providing a gamified experience that makes learning and interacting with blockchain fun and rewarding. Each quest is designed to educate and engage, ensuring users gain valuable knowledge while enjoying the process.
